# Grade 125/125

This was a fun project, first time using static variables.

The project consists on reading an fd (gave by open() function),
and store it in our variable till we get a new line (\n).

The use of the read() function and how it worked(with the BUFFER_SIZE).

Bonus part, was reading various fd's without loosing any info about the previous one.

Nice ally to the libft project!

Subject of the project included on repository.
